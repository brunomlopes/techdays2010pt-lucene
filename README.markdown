Code and presentation used in my TechDays 2010 PT Lucene session
========

The sample data was taken from a screen scraping of the http://www.techdays2010.com website. The script used is in `scripts\extract.py`.

The presentation is in the root folder.

If you wish to run the demo code, you need to decompress the `data\speakers.zip` file and point the fields defined in Configuration.cs to the correct location.
 
Lucene was compiled from the 2.9.1 tag [here][1]
